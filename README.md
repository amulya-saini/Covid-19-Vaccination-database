# Covid-19-vaccination-database

The "COVID-19 Vaccination Data Management" repository is dedicated to the development of a unified database designed to store comprehensive information about COVID-19 vaccinations for citizens from different countries. The primary goal of this project is to bridge the accessibility gap in vaccination data for airport facilities and other organizations, enabling real-time verification of vaccination claims. This initiative is motivated by the need to combat vaccine hesitancy and the proliferation of fraudulent vaccination claims.
